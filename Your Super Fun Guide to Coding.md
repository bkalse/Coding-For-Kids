### For Kids (Around 8 Years Old)

## 👋 Hey There, Future Coder!

Welcome to the world of **coding**!  
Coding means giving instructions to a computer to do **cool things** — like making a game, drawing pictures, or creating your own animated story!

Let’s learn step by step — with games, challenges, and fun!

---

## 🧠 Step 1: What Is Coding?

Imagine you're the **boss** of a robot.  
You tell it what to do like this:

🗣️  
1. Walk forward  
2. Turn left  
3. Say “Hello!”

That’s **coding** — giving step-by-step instructions so the robot (or computer) does exactly what you want!

---

## 🧪 Step 2: Play the "If-Then" Game

Let’s try something fun!

Say this out loud:

> 🧠 "If it’s raining, **then** take an umbrella."

Now you try!

- If I’m hungry, then ___________  
- If I finish homework, then ___________

🎉 You just used **logical thinking** — a big part of coding!

## 🎨 Step 3: Let’s Make Something on Scratch!

**Scratch** is a free website where you can make your own games, stories, and animations — just by dragging colorful blocks!

### 🌐 Go to: [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu)

### 🧑‍💻 Do This:
1. Click on **"Create"** at the top.
2. You’ll see a cute cat 🐱 on the screen.
3. Try dragging blocks like:

🟩 when green flag clicked 

🟦 say "Let’s dance!" for 2 seconds 

🟨 repeat 10 

⬛ turn 15 degrees 

⬛ move 10 steps 



Click the green flag ▶️ and watch your cat **dance!**

Try changing:
- The sprite (pick a new character!)
- The words
- The background

🎉 Yay! You made your first program!

## 🧱 Step 4: Learn with Projects

Here are some **fun things** you can make in Scratch:

| Idea                    | What It Teaches                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Make a sprite walk      | Steps in a row (sequence)        |
| Make something repeat   | Loops (do it again and again)    |
| Press space to jump     | Events (triggers)                |
| Score goes up           | Variables (keeping numbers)      |

### 🎮 Try This Game:
- Make a character that **chases your mouse**
- When it touches the mouse, **add 1 point**
- Add music, colors, or a timer!
